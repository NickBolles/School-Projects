#Term Scheduler

This is a spreadsheet I made that calculates your GPA and makes use of advanced Excel features and functions such as:

- VLookup
- Hlookup
- IfError
- SumIf, CountIf
- Grouping
- Custom Code
- Named Cells/Tables
- Conditional Formatting
- Fairly complex functions
- Protecting worksheets, with individually locked cells
- and more…

I made it fairly general so that I could distribute it to others. Several others have used it and love it. This is partially the motivation for my app, Four See. This feature will be coming in a future version of the app, because it is more complex than the current use of the app.
